# MakeGuid
make a GUID from commadline

Just a simple project for genereate a GUID on commandline, becurse this is needed when making new apps for Microsoft Buisness Central.

Build
It a standard dotnet core project so a dotnet build will do it, but the batch file (Windows) make a standalone without force me to
remeber all paramters.
